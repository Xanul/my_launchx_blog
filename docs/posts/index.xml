      <description>In this first blogpost i want to talk about the software development culture and what it means to me to be a professional software developer, first I consider that being a good professional programmer implies a series of skills that must be combined to quality works and projects, some of the main skills and characteristics that I consider are important for a good software developer are:
-Willingness and desire to continue learning new technologies, concepts, and tools -Tolerance to frustration and patience to solve problems in a calm and orderly manner -Ability to be self-taught and learn by themselves, managing to find useful information about the current topic or subject, but always appreciating the knowledge from others -Pleasure to work in a team, always prioritizing respect for others and having organization and willingness to advance and work as a team -Passion and love for technology!</description>
