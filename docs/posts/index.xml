      <description>Lately I have found myself using GIT and GitHub much more frequently than in the past, mainly thanks to the projects and exercises that are part of the LaunchX course, in where the MC (Mission Commander of the course üöÄ) has made a lot of emphasis in the importance of the constant use of Git and GitHub in our everyday contact with code.
Personally, since I started learning about GIT, I notice it was a very important tool, especially for collaborative work, but in more recent times I have discovered how important it is for the individual and personal work, not only because it let us have versions and return to them if a bug or an error happens in the development, but mainly (and this is the part I recently pondered that I consider very important) because it allow us to have a history log, written by ourselves, with the description and changes we have made to the project in the time of the commit, this doesn‚Äôt seems to be very impactful, but in my recent experience, it has a lot of relevance, because it‚Äôs very common for me (and for a lot of people working with code) that if I‚Äôm working on a project and I put it on ‚Äúpause‚Äù to work in other developments, when I go back to the project, it‚Äôs very hard to remember what was the latest thing that I did to the code, what does the functions do, what is the next step to work, where should I begin!</description>

      <description>In this first blogpost i want to talk about the software development culture and what it means to me to be a professional software developer, first I consider that being a good professional programmer implies a series of skills that must be combined to quality works and projects, some of the main skills and characteristics that I consider are important for a good software developer are:
  Willingness and desire to continue learning new technologies, concepts, and tools.</description>
